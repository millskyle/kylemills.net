In 2015 I completed my Bachelor's of Science in physics, with a minor in mathematics, and began my Master's in Modelling and Computational Sciences.  In 2017, I transitioned directly to my PhD.  I am interested in general applications of computational models and techniques to scientific research, specifically in the application of deep neural networks and machine learning to problems in materials science.  I enjoy learning new things and applying my knowledge of physics, math, and programming to solve problems and produce useful and creative projects.  I have a broad range of technical skills ranging from graphic/web design to scientific high-performance computing. Below are just some of the tools and languages I use regularly:"
